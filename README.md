# hello-world
Hi everyone!!
   Amar here,
           I like coding languages such as java,c,c++ as i recently finished my projects on them.Knowledge and Technology fascinates me.
           And so here i am getting into the field of android development and web development.I am constantly making projects on them and              would serve as a workaholic employee to the person who will be assigning me a project no matter how small or big .
